# VB_using_buildroot
This repository provides a minimal embedded Linux system built using Buildroot, and tested on QEMU (ARM VersatilePB board). It includes ready-to-use scripts to quickly launch a virtual embedded Linux environment for learning, testing, and development.
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project demonstrates how to build and run an embedded Linux system using:

Buildroot â†’ for cross-compilation and generating rootfs/kernel/toolchain

QEMU (ARM) â†’ to emulate embedded hardware (VersatilePB board)

It provides a step-by-step script to quickly boot Linux in a virtual ARM machine without physical hardware.

ðŸ”‘ Why this repo is useful?

Learn embedded Linux basics (kernel, rootfs, init system)

Practice cross-compilation and toolchains

Test applications in QEMU before deploying to real hardware

Prepare for interviews or embedded projects
